This project was built to help understand the working of different sorting algorithms when they are introduced to handle data in real time. The project demonstrates the performances of these sorting algorithms by giving a visual representation of the whole thing including the time and array accesses that each of these sorting algorithms take. The code was written in Java swing. 
The project features many sorting algorithms including :
Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Bubble Sort, Shell Sort, Count Sort, Odd Even sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort and many more.
